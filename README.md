This respositories provides a set of model validation and analysis tools in the form of python jupyter Notebooks.
They were developed as part of WP8 in the IMMERSE Horizons 2020 project and offer best practice examples of how to
share analysis and assessment approaches among downstream users. They relate to the four downstream case studies in IMMERSE:

T8.2 Coastal processes in German Bight (Hereon) 

T8.3 Marine plastic litter transport (Univeristy of Utrecht)

T8.4 Water quality modelling of the Tamar Estuary and adjacent coast (Plymouth Marine Laboratory)

T8.5 Pollution transport by Submesoscales in the open ocean (University of Bologna)

Each case study notebook is accomanined by a readme file, providing a complete description of how to setup and run the Notebook,
including installing an appropriate python environment and accessing the data. Data for T8.2, T8.3 and T8.5 are available on zenodo.org, while data for T8.4 in provided by an on-line THREDDS server. 

The case study notebooks can run easily on local computer resources (e.g. windows, linux or mac desktops/laptops), with an suitable python environment installed, e.g. via anaconda (www.anaconda.com) They can also run on cload based systems, such as the WEkEO Data and Information Access Services (DIAS; https://www.wekeo.eu/) system. Case study Notebooks T8.2, 4, and 5 run on the Machine Learning python environment provided with WEkEO. The T8.3 Notebook includes an application of oceanparcels Lagrangian model. The reqired data volume for the accomanying NEMO model data and the required python environment together exceed the storage capacity available for free WEkEO DIAS access.
